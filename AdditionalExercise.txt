I can't believe it's been over 10 years since I started my first job. I remember getting paid $8 per hour, which seemed like a lot at the time. Now, the minimum wage in our state has gone up to $12.50 per hour. That's a significant increase! Since then, I've worked at 5 different companies and have learned so much. I've also made many friends and met some incredible people. In total, I've made around $250,000 in my career so far. It's crazy to think about all the things that have happened in the past 10 years, but I'm excited to see what the future holds.
