 The term domestic dog refers to any of several hundred breeds of dog in the world today. While these animals vary drastically in appearance, every dog from the Chihuahua to the Great Daneâ€”is a member of the same species, Canis familiaris. This separates domestic dogs from wild canines, such as coyotes, foxes, and wolves.
